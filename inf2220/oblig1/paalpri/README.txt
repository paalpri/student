compile:
        javac *.java // javac oblig1.java Ordbok.java
Main-method in oblig1.java

Made the assumption that the user have and know the name of the file with the words.

Everything works!

the insert and delete method is influenced by codes in the textbook, but also made an insert method which is 100% mine, this one also works and is in the bottom. to use it you only have to decomment it and change all accurencies of insert with settInn. just not as good code so i went with the one who is influenced.
